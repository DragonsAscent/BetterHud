If you successfully installed this plugin, this files is automatically generated.  
And you should **merge the build folder to your resource pack**.
``` yaml
merge_other_plugins_resourcepacks_folders:
  - "BetterHud/build"
```
If you have ItemsAdder, you can simply merge it by writing this in ItemsAdder's config.
